#GenIA - AI Powered NFT Platform 


## Overview

GenIA is a platform that allows users to enter a command prompt to generate an image and simultaneously mint it as an NFT on the Aurora Blockchain. These NFTs can then be instantly sold on our platform for GenIA tokens, which can be used to pay for the generation of new images using AI prompts. Our tokens can be easily purchased using QR Code payments through PIX, the brazilian way of sending money fast and tax-free.

## Technologies Used
*Typescript and Next.js for the front-end
*MetaMask to connect the user with the front-end
*MetaMask Flask (snaps?)
*LayerX for connect the front-end functionalities to the contracts
*Aurora blockchain for minting NFTs
*ERC20 and ERC721 protocols for the GenIA token and NFTs
*Polygon for bridging between Aurora and Chainlink
*Chainlink for connecting to our own API (back-end)
*Node.js for the back-end
*DALL-E2 API for generating AI images
*Cloudinary for storing the images with a default URL

## Features
*Generate and mint NFTs with AI images using the DALL-E2 API and the Aurora blockchain
*Connect your MetaMask wallet to the website and interact with the application
*View your own NFTs generated by DALL-E2 on the website
*Browse a marketplace of NFTs minted by other users

## Flowchart
This is how the application works.
Our front-end uses LayerX to connect to the Aurora blockchain to make requests. At the same time, it is possible to use your MetaMask to buy our ERC20 token (GenIA), which will be used to mint a ERC721 NFT. 
This is our GenIA token:

To make the mint to really work, we use a bridge connection to Polygon so we can use Chainlink protocol to make some API calls to our back-end. This allows us to make on-chain API calls directly to our back-end, which will send another call to the OpenAI API for the image generation with DALL-E2 AI. After that, the image is stored into Cloudinary with a previously settled URL, so we can make it easy to show up the NFTs in our front-end application (in My Collections and in NFT Marketplace spaces).

When you load the page you will see a brief about how to use GenIA. On the same page, you will see the Try GenIA button. After clicking on it, you will be asked to connect your MetaMask to the site. After you successfully connect your MetaMask, you will be able to see a text box to input your own PROMPT - which will be used to generate an AI image from DALL-E2 API -, you will be able to mint a NFT on Aurora blockchain by clicking on Generate.
Also, you always are able to scroll down the main page to see the AI generated NFT Marketplace that is in there from other users selling their own NFTs. There, if you have a connection with MetaMask on the site, you will be able to buy other people's NFTs.
If you have your wallet connected, you will also be able to click on My Collection to see your own AI generated NFT collection! There, you also will be able to SELL your NFT in the webpage marketplace, choosing the price in GenIA Token.
